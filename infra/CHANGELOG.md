## v0.4.8

  - v0.4.8 introduces simplified examples, with a single cloud module dependency. if your Terraform
    configuration is based on an example from an earlier version, and you wish to migrate to this
    new structure, append contents of `migration-v0.4.8.tf` to your `main.tf` and apply it. You can
    revert this change after one successful apply.
