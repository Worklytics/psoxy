# packages psoxy for deployment

# TODO: solve weirdness with AWS case: AWS lambda is deployed directly by Terraform from a code
# package built by terraform, but terraform doesn't understand this dependency in its plan. we make
# it work via explicit 'depends_on', but Terraform still gives 'error inconsistent plan' as its
# original plan presumed the sha-256 of the package

# build psoxy bundle with external build script, via a 'data' resource.
# NOTE: since invoked via 'data', happens during plan, rather than 'apply'; this is incorrect
# semantics if you view the package as a 'resource', but is reasonable if you view it as just a
# configuration value (eg, the content of a lambda function)
# NOTE: pass deployment jar path through the script simply to make outputs of this Terraform module
# dependent on the build script actually running, avoiding Terraform thinking the outputs are
# known prior to executing the build
