# aws-msft-365

This example provisions psoxy as an AWS lambda that connects to Microsoft 365 data sources.

## Authentication

### AWS
Follow [`docs/aws/getting-started.md`](../../../docs/aws/getting-started.md) to setup AWS CLI to
authenticate as a user/role which can access/create the AWS account in which you wish to provision
your psoxy instance.

### Azure AD (Microsoft 365)
Download and install the [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).
This example presumes you'll authenticate that via `az login`, such that the [Terraform Azure
provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azuread/latest/docs) will leverage those
credentials for authentication. This is Terraform's recommended approach for authenticating when
running locally/interactively and our documentation will generally presume you're using this
approach.  If that doesn't suite your organization needs, the Terraform docs linked above provide
alternatives, but this will require your own modification to the example configuration.

If your target MSFT tenant (specified in `terraform.tfvars`) lacks an Azure subscription (eg, is
only Microsoft 365), you should auth with `az login --allow-no-subscriptions`.


## Example Configuration

Example `terraform.tfvars`:
```terraform
aws_account_id                = "123456789" # your AWS account ID
aws_assume_role_arn           = "arn:aws:iam::123456789:role/InfraAdmin" # sufficiently privileged role within your AWS account to provision necessary infra
caller_aws_arns = [
  "arn:aws:iam::914358739851:root" # for production use, this should be Worklytics' AWS account; for testing, it can be your own AWS account
]
caller_gcp_service_account_ids = [
  "123456712345671234567" # 21-digit numeric string you should obtain from Worklytics
]
msft_tenant_id                = "some-uuid-of-msft-tenant" # should hold your Microsoft 365 instance
```


## Security

This example includes generation of certificates for your Azure AD application listings.
   - anyone in possession of those certificates could access your data with whatever permissions you
     grant to the Azure AD application.
   - this example should be used with caution and only run from a location that, based on your
     org's infosec rules, can be used to generate such a certificate.
   - the terraform state produced by this module should be persisted to a secure location, such as
     an encrypted disk of a VM dedicated for this purpose OR a cloud storage service (GCS, S3 etc).
     It is generally NOT good practice to commit such state files to a source code repository such
     as git/github.
