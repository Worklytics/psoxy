# AWS


Example Terraform configuration for deploying psoxy in AWS and connecting to Google Workspace sources.

See [../modules/aws-google-workspace] for generic bits encapsulated as a module.  What's in this
configuration itself is the stuff that we expect needs to be customized on per-org basis.

## Getting Started

We recommend you make a copy of this directory and customize it for your org. Run `init.sh` to get
started.
