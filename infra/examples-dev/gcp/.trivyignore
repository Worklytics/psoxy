# GCS bucket does not use a CMEK
# GCS buckets are encrypted by default, with google default keys; proxy tf modules do not provision
# a CMEK by default, to avoid imposing additional cost/complexity on users. If you wish to do so,
# this can be configured via composition - as all gcs bucket ids are provides as outputs from our
# modules.
