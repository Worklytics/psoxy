# Trivy rule that checks that S3 buckets are encrypted
# all AWS S3 buckets are encrypted by default with AWS S3 managed keys; see
# https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/UsingServerSideEncryption.html?icmpid=docs_s3_hp_edit_default_encryption_encryption_key_type
# for this default, we do NOT need to specify encryption explicity in the Proxy modules; so we
# avoid doing so to give customers flexibility; if desired, see `kms-cmek.tf` for example of how to
# configure more sophisticated encryption options on S3 buckets created by proxy via composition,
# which is the preferred Terraform design pattern for doing so

# Trivy rule for custom CMEK for customers; because this imposes additional cost/complexity, and S3
# is encrypted by default with AWS-managed keys, Proxy modules DO NOT create custom CMEK + encryption
# config for S3 buckets; if desired, see `kms-cmek.tf` file in example; uncomment it and customize
# as needed.

# Trivy rule that checks that versioning is enabled on S3 buckets
# as of v0.4.58, we don't version S3 buckets created by proxy by default; this is because proxy S3
# buckets are NOT intended to be used as a long-term storage solution
# if desired, see `s3-extra-sec.tf` for an example of enabling versioning on proxy buckets

# Trivy rule that checks that logging is enabled for customer buckets
# as this would impose additional cost/complexity, Proxy modules DO NOT enable logging on
# S3 buckets; if desired, see `s3-extra-sec.tf` for an example of enabling logging on proxy buckets
# (it would also be circular to do this internally to the Proxy modules; if it provisioned a bucket
#  for logs, should it also enable logging for that log bucket? where to the logs for the logs
#  bucket go?)
