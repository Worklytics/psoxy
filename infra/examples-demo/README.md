# Examples - Demos

Directory to hold demo examples, if need to illustrate customization beyond what is in `examples/`.

A .gitignore file should prevent any subdirectories, which will contain the specific demo configs,
from being committed. Nonetheless, any reference to customers should still use code names/aliases,
rather than any customer-identifying information - regardless of contract terms.
