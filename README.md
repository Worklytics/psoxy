# psoxy
A serverless, pseudonymizing proxy to sit between Worklytics and the REST API of a 3rd-party data
source.

Psoxy replaces PII in your organization's data with hash tokens to enable Worklytics's analysis to
be performed on anonymized data which we cannot map back to any identifiable individual.

It is intended to be a simple, serverless, transparent solution to provide more granular access to
data source APIs.
  - **serverless** - we strive to minimize the moving pieces required to run psoxy at scale, keeping
     your attack surface small and operational complexity low. Furthermore, we define
     infrastructure-as-code to ease setup.
  - **transparent** - psoxy's source code is available to customers, to facilitate code review
     and white box penetration testing.
  - **simple** - psoxy's functionality will focus on performing secure authentication with the 3rd
     party API and then perform minimal transformation on the response (pseudonymization, field
     redcation). to ease code review and auditing of its behavior.

As of Dec 2021, psoxy instances may be hosted in [Google Cloud ](docs/gcp/development.md) or
[AWS](docs/aws/getting-started.md).

## Data Flow

A Psoxy instances reside on your premises (in the cloud) and act as an intermediary between
Worklytics and the data source you wish to connect.  In this role, the proxy performs the
authentication necessary to connect to the data source's API and then any required transformation
(such as pseudonymization or redaction) on the response.

Orchestration continues to be performed on the Worklytics-side.

## Getting Started - Customers

### Prereqs
As of Oct 2021, Psoxy is implemented with Java 11 and built via Maven. Infrastructure is provisioned
via Terraform, relying on Google Cloud and/or AWS command line tools.  You will need recent
versions of all of the following:

  - git
  - Java 11+ JDK variant
  - [Maven 3.6+](https://maven.apache.org/docs/history.html)
  - [terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) optional; if you don't use this, you'll need to configure
    your GCP/AWS project via the web console/CLI tools. Writing your own terraform config that
    re-uses our modules will simplify things greatly.

And, depending on your scenario, you may also need:
  - [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html) is
    required to deploy your psoxy instances in AWS.
  - [Google Cloud Command Line tool](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) Required to host
    your psoxy instances in GCP *OR* if you plan to connect Google Workspace as a data source. It
    should be configured for the GCP project that will host your psoxy instance(s) and/or your
    connectors.
  - [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) Required to connect to
    Microsoft 365 sources.
  - [openssl](https://www.openssl.org/) If generating local certificates (see
    [`infra/modules/azure-local-cert`](infra/modules/azuread-local-cert))

We recommend using Cloud Shell from one of the major cloud providers, such as:
  - [Google Cloud Shell](https://cloud.google.com/shell/) - if you're using GCP or connecting to
    Google Workspace, this is the recommended option. It [includes the prereqs above](https://cloud.google.com/shell/docs/how-cloud-shell-works#tools) EXCEPT aws/azure CLIs.
  - [AWS CloudShell](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudshell/) - if you're deploying to AWS.

These cloud shell environments simplify authentication and, given that you may need to manage secrets
for some data sources, provide a more secure location than your laptop to store your Terraform state.

### Setup
1. contact support@worklytics.co to ensure your Worklytics account is enabled for Psoxy, and to get
   the email of your Worklytics tenant's service account.

2. OPTIONAL; [create a private fork](docs/private-fork.md) of this repo; we recommend this to allow you to commit your
   specific configurations/changes while continuing to periodically fetch any changes from public
   repo.

3. create a [terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) configuration, setting up your environment, psoxy
   instances, and API keys/secrets for each connection
   a. various examples are provided in [`infra/examples`](/infra/examples)
   b. various modules are provided in [`infra/modules`](/infra/modules); these modules will either
      perform all the necessary setup, or create TODO files explaining what you must do outside
      Terraform

4. init Terraform configuration and generate an initial plan
```shell
terraform init
terraform plan -out=tfplan.out
```

5. review the plan and ensure it matches the infrastructure you expect:
```shell
terraform show tfplan.out
```

Edit your Terraform configuration to modify/remove resources as needed.

Use `terraform import` where needed for Terraform to re-use existing resources, rather than
recreate them (for example, to use GCP project that already exists).

6. apply your configuration
```shell
terraform apply
```

7. follow any `TODO` instructions produced by Terraform, such as:
  - build and deploy JAR (built from this repo) into your environment
  - provision API keys / make OAuth grants needed by each Data Connection
  - create the Data Connection from Worklytics to your psoxy instance (Terraform can provide `TODO`
    file with detailed steps for each

## Releases

### v0.4 - rc
The `main` branch is current at 0.4.

Current status is **release-candidate**; breaking changes to java are anticipated, but we recommend new test deployments use this version to get latest Terraform module structure.

Features:
  - **transiently reversible pseudonyms** - rules to support returning  'transiently' reversible pseudonyms client, which can be encrypted using key available to psoxy instances (and expected to rotate, such that reversible only until it is rotated).
  - **endpoint-based rules, including sub-endpoints** - fully move to 'Rules 2.0', dropping support for 'Rules 1.0' format; and allow 'Rules 2.0' to be recursive (endpoints having endpoints

Breaking changes:
  - drop support for 'Rules 1.0' format
  - default pseudonym format will have hashes based only on canonical identifier + salt, not considering the 'scope' in which the identifier
   appears; and will be base64-urlencoded plain strings, rather than nested JSON.


### v0.3 - beta

This is the current recommended release for all existing deployments OR
any new deployment for production use.
 - a `v0.3` branch is available on GitHub; this will get fixes/non-breaking changes as they're available.
 - tagged releases will be provided for anyone who wants a fixed version; latest is `v0.3.0-beta.6`

## Supported Data Sources
As of May 2022, the following sources can be connected to Worklytics via psoxy:

  * Asana
  * Google Workspace
    * Calendar
    * Chat
    * Directory
    * Drive
    * GMail
    * Meet
  * Microsoft 365
    * Active Directory
    * Calendar
    * Mail
  * Slack
    * eDiscovery API
  * Zoom


You can also use the command line tool to pseudonymize arbitrary CSV files (eg, exports from your
HRIS), in a manner consistent with how a psoxy instance will pseudonymize identifiers in a target
REST API. This is REQUIRED if you want SaaS accounts to be linked with HRIS data for analysis (eg,
Worklytics will match email set in HRIS with email set in SaaS tool's account - so these must be
pseudonymized using an equivalent algorithm and secret). See [`java/impl/cmd-line/`](/java/impl/cmd-line)
for details.
