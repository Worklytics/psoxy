name: Publish GCP Bundle

# This workflow publishes GCP bundles to GCS using OIDC authentication.
#
# Required GitHub Secrets:
#   - GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT: Service account email (e.g., gh-actions@example-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com)
#   - GCP_WORKLOAD_IDENTITY_PROVIDER: Full provider path (e.g., projects/123456789/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/github-actions/providers/github)
#
# Security:
#   - Uses OIDC authentication (no long-lived credentials)
#   - OIDC provider validates repository_owner == 'Worklytics'
#   - workflow_dispatch requires write access (enforced by GitHub)
#   - Tag pushes require push access (enforced by GitHub)
#   - RC branch pushes require write access (enforced by GitHub)
#   - Consider adding branch protection rules to restrict who can push tags and create rc-* branches
