name: Publish AWS Bundle

# This workflow publishes AWS bundles to S3 using OIDC authentication.
#
# Required GitHub Secrets:
#   - AWS_ROLE_ARN: IAM role ARN to assume (e.g., arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/GithubActionPublishAgent)
#
# Security:
#   - Uses OIDC authentication (no long-lived credentials)
#   - OIDC provider validates repository_owner == 'Worklytics'
#   - workflow_dispatch requires write access (enforced by GitHub)
#   - Tag pushes require push access (enforced by GitHub)
#   - RC branch pushes require write access (enforced by GitHub)
#   - Consider adding branch protection rules to restrict who can push tags and create rc-* branches
