  # Java 20 - support ended 19 Sept 2023
  # NOTE: psoxy versions 0.4.40 supported this; if you need it, option to downgrade to that.
  # although beyond me why 17 and 21 both work, but 20 doesn't; best guess is Mockito 5 degrading
  # behavior in some way for 20 that isn't needed for 21 and doesn't matter for 17?
