### Change implications

 - dependencies added/changed? **yes (explain) / no**
 - something important to note in future release notes?
   - NOTE in `CHANGELOG.md` anything that will show up in `terraform plan`/`apply` that isn't
     obviously a no-op?
   - breaking changes? if in module/example that is NOT marked `alpha`, requires major version
     change
