# API Call Examples for Google Workspace

Example commands (*) that you can use to validate proxy behavior against the Google Workspace APIs.
Follow the steps and change the values to match your configuration when needed.

For GCP, you can use the `-i` flag to impersonate the desired user identity option when running the testing tool. Example:

```shell
node tools/test-psoxy.js -u [your_psoxy_url]/psoxy-gcal/calendar/v3/calendars/primary -i you@acme.com
```

For AWS, change the role to impersonate with one with sufficient permissions to call the proxy (`-r` flag). Example:

```shell
node tools/test-psoxy.js -u [your_psoxy_url]/psoxy-gcal/calendar/v3/calendars/primary -r arn:aws:iam::PROJECT_ID:role/ROLE_NAME
```

If any call appears to fail, repeat it using the `-v` flag.

(*) All commands assume that you are at the root path of the Psoxy project.

````

2. Get event information (replace `calendar_event_id` with the corresponding value):
```
node tools/test-psoxy.js -u [your_psoxy_url]/psoxy-gcal/calendar/v3/calendars/primary/events/[calendar_event_id]
```

```

2. Get group information (replace `google_group_id` with the corresponding value):

```

### Group Members
```shell
node tools/test-psoxy.js -u [your_psoxy_url]/psoxy-gdirectory/admin/directory/v1/groups/[google_group_id]/members
```

### Users

## Drive

### Files
```shell
node tools/test-psoxy.js -u [your_psoxy_url]/psoxy-gdrive/drive/v2/files
```

```shell
node tools/test-psoxy.js -u [your_psoxy_url]/psoxy-gdrive/drive/v3/files
```

### File

```shell
node tools/test-psoxy.js -u [your_psoxy_url]/psoxy-gdrive/drive/v2/files
```

2. Get file details (replace [drive_file_id] with the corresponding value): 
```shell
node tools/test-psoxy.js -u [your_psoxy_url]/psoxy-gdrive/drive/v3/files/[drive_file_id]?fields=*
```

### File Revisions
YMMV, as file at index `0` must actually be a type that supports revisions for this to return
anything. You can play with different file IDs until you find something that does.
```shell
node tools/test-psoxy.js -u [your_psoxy_url]/psoxy-gdrive/drive/v2/files/[drive_file_id]/revisions
```

```shell

```

### Permissions

```shell
node tools/test-psoxy.js -u [your_psoxy_url]/psoxy-gdrive/drive/v2/files/[drive_file_id]/permissions
```

```shell
node tools/test-psoxy.js -u [your_psoxy_url]/psoxy-gdrive/drive/v2/files/[drive_file_id]/permissions?fields=*
```

### Comments
YMMV, as file at index `0` must actually be a type that has comments for this to return
anything. You can play with different file IDs until you find something that does.

**NOTE probably blocked by OAuth metadata only scope!!**
```shell
node tools/test-psoxy.js -u [your_psoxy_url]/psoxy-gdrive/drive/v2/files/[drive_file_id]/comments
```

```shell
node tools/test-psoxy.js -u [your_psoxy_url]/psoxy-gdrive/drive/v2/files/[drive_file_id]/comments?fields=*
```

### Comment

**NOTE probably blocked by OAuth metadata only scope!!**

1. Get file comment ID (accessor path in response `.items[0].id`):
```shell
node tools/test-psoxy.js -u [your_psoxy_url]/psoxy-gdrive/drive/v2/files/[drive_file_id]/comments
```

2. Get file comment details (replace `file_comment_id` with the corresponding value):
```shell
node tools/test-psoxy.js -u [your_psoxy_url]/psoxy-gdrive/drive/v2/files/[drive_file_id]/comments/[file_comment_id]
```

### Replies
**NOTE probably blocked by OAuth metadata only scope!!**

YMMV, as above, play with the file comment ID value until you find a file with comments, and a comment that
has replies.

```shell
node tools/test-psoxy.js -u [your_psoxy_url]/psoxy-gdrive/drive/v2/files/[drive_file_id]/comments/[file_comment_id]/replies
