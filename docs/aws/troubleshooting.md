# AWS Troubleshooting

Tips and tricks for using AWS as to host the proxy.

## Who are you?

```shell
# figure out how your AWS CLI is authenticated
# (NOTE: this is also the only AWS API cmd that will work regardless of your IAM setup; asking AWS
# who it believes you are doesn't require any permissions)
aws sts get-caller-identity

# figure out if the identity you're authenticated as can assume target role
aws sts assume-role \
--role-arn arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/InfraAdmin \
--role-session-name TestSession \
--output json
```

If above doesn't happen seem to work as expected, some ideas in the next section may help.

## Your AWS Organization uses SSO via Okta or some similar provider

Options:
  1. execute terraform via [AWS Cloud Shell](cloud-shell.md)
  2. find credentials output by your SSO helper (eg, `aws-okta`) then fill the AWS CLI env variables yourself:

```shell
ls ~/.aws/cli/cached/


...

export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
export AWS_SESSION_TOKEN="xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
```

  3. if your SSO helper fills default AWS credentials file but simply doesn't set the env vars, you
 may be able to export the profile to `AWS_PROFILE`, eg
```shell

export AWS_PROFILE="production"
terraform plan

# or just inline

AWS_PROFILE="production" terraform plan
```

## Your AWS User has MFA

Options:
  - execute terraform via [AWS Cloud Shell](cloud-shell.md)
  - use a script such as [aws-mfa](https://github.com/broamski/aws-mfa) to get short-lived key+secret for your user.

## Logs via Cloud Watch

### via Web Console

  1. Log into AWS web console
  2. navigate to the AWS account that hosts your proxy instance (you may need to assume a
     role in that account)
  3. then the region in that account in which your proxy instance is deployed.
     (default `us-east-1`)
  4. then search or navigate to the `AWS Lambda`s feature, and find the specific one you
     wish to debug
  5. find the tabs for `Monitoring` then within that, `Logging`, then click "go to Cloud Watch"


### via CLI

Unless your AWS CLI is auth'd as a user who can review logs, first auth it for such a role.

You can do this with a new profile, or setting env variables as follows:

```shell
export $(printf "AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=%s AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=%s AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=%s" \
$(aws sts assume-role \
--role-arn arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/MyAssumedRole \
--role-session-name MySessionName \
--query "Credentials.[AccessKeyId,SecretAccessKey,SessionToken]" \
--output text))
````

Then, you can do a series of commands as follows:
```shell
aws logs describe-log-streams --log-group-name /aws/lambda/psoxy-azure-ad
aws logs get-log events --log-group-name /aws/lambda/psoxy-azure-ad --log-stream-name [VALUE_FROM_LAST_COMMAND]
```

## Errors in Terraform apply

### error creating Lambda Function URL

Something like the following:
```
Error: error creating Lambda Function URL (psoxy-outlook-mail): ResourceConflictException: Failed to create function url config for [functionArn = arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:123456789012:function:psoxy-outlook-mail]. Error message:  FunctionUrlConfig exists for this Lambda function
│ {
│   RespMetadata: {
│     StatusCode: 409,
│     RequestID: "dfb1452c-df84-4231-946f-b97deb695ca9"
│   },
│   Message_: "Failed to create function url config for [functionArn = arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:123456789012:function:psoxy-outlook-mail]. Error message:  FunctionUrlConfig exists for this Lambda function",
│   Type: "User"
│ }
│
│   with module.psoxy-msft-connector["outlook-mail"].aws_lambda_function_url.lambda_url,
│   on ../../modules/aws-psoxy-rest/main.tf line 26, in resource "aws_lambda_function_url" "lambda_url":
│   26: resource "aws_lambda_function_url" "lambda_url" {
```

Your Terraform state is inconsistent. Run something like the following, adapted for your connector:

```shell
terraform import module.psoxy-msft-connector\[\"outlook-mail\"\].aws_lambda_function_url.lambda_url psoxy-outlook-mail
```

NOTE: you likely need to change `outlook-mail` if your error is with a different data source. The
`\` chars are needed to escape the double-quotes/brackets in your bash command.

## Permissions Errors

### error reading SSM Parameters

Something like the following:
```
Error loading class co.worklytics.psoxy.Handler: missing config. no value for PSOXY_SALT: java.lang.Error
java.lang.Error: missing config. no value for PSOXY_SALT
```

Check:
  - the SSM parameter exists in the AWS account
  - the execution role for the lambda has an attached IAM policy that allows the SSM parameter to 
    be read

Our Terraform examples should provide both of the above for you, but worth double-checking.

If those are present, yet the error persists, it's possible that you have some org-level security
constraint/policy preventing SSM parameters from being used / read. For example, you have a 
"default deny" policy set for SSM GET actions/etc.  In such a case, you need to add the execute 
roles for each lambda as exceptions to such policies (find these under AWS --> IAM --> Roles).
