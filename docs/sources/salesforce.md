# Salesforce

## Examples

* [Example Rules](example-rules/salesforce/salesforce.yaml)
* Example Data : [original](api-response-examples/salesforce) | [sanitized](api-response-examples/salesforce/sanitized)

## Steps to Connect

Before running the example, you have to populate the following variables in terraform:
- `salesforce_domain`. This is the [domain](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.faq_domain_name_what.htm&type=5) your instance is using.
- `salesforce_example_account_id`: An example of any account id; this is only applicable for example calls.

1. Create a [Salesforce application + client credentials flow](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?language=en_US&id=sf.remoteaccess_oauth_client_credentials_flow.htm&type=5)
   with following permissions:
   - Manage user data via APIs (`api`)
   - Access Connect REST API resources (`chatter_api`)
   - Perform requests at any time (`refresh_token`, `offline_access`)
   - Access unique user identifiers (`openid`)
   - Access Lightning applications (`lightning`)
   - Access content resources (`content`)
   - Perform ANSI SQL queries on Customer Data Platform data (`cdp_query_api`)

     Apart from Salesforce instructions above, please review the following:
       - "Callback URL" MUST be filled; can be anything as not required in this flow, but required to be set by Salesforce.
       - Application MUST be marked with "Enable Client Credentials Flow"
       - You MUST assign a user for Client Credentials, be sure:
           - you associate a "run as" user marked with "API Only Permission"
           - The policy associated to the user MUST have the following Administrative Permissions enabled:
               - API Enabled
               - APEX REST Services
       - The policy MUST have the application marked as "enabled" in "Connected App Access". Otherwise requests will return 401 with INVALID_SESSION_ID

     The user set for "run as" on the connector should have, between its `Permission Sets` and `Profile`, the permission of `View All Data`. This is required
     to support the queries used to retrieve [Activity Histories](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.object_reference.meta/object_reference/sforce_api_objects_activityhistory.htm) by *account id*.

2. Once created, open "Manage Consumer Details"
3. Update the content of `PSOXY_SALESFORCE_CLIENT_ID` from Consumer Key	and `PSOXY_SALESFORCE_CLIENT_SECRET` from Consumer Secret
4. Finally, we recommend to run `test-salesforce` script with all the queries in the example to ensure the expected information covered by rules can be obtained from Salesforce API.
   Some test calls may fail with a 400 (bad request) response. That is something expected if parameters requested on the query are not available (for example, running a SOQL query
   with fields that are NOT present in your model will force a 400 response from Salesforce API). If that is the case, a double check in the function logs can be done to ensure
   that this is the actual error happening, you should see an error like the following one:
     ```json
     WARNING: Source API Error [{
    "message": "\nLastModifiedById,NumberOfEmployees,OwnerId,Ownership,ParentId,Rating,Sic,Type\n                                           
               ^\nERROR at Row:1:Column:136\nNo such column 'Ownership' on entity 'Account'. If you are attempting to use a custom field, be sure to append the '__c' after the custom field name. Please reference your WSDL or the describe call for the appropriate names.",
    "errorCode": "INVALID_FIELD"
     }]
     ```
   In that case, removing from the query the fields LastModifiedById,NumberOfEmployees,OwnerId,Ownership,ParentId,Rating,Sic,Type will fix the issues.

   However, if running any of the queries you receive a 401/403/500/512 it may be related to some misconfiguration in the Salesforce Application (a 401/403 might be related to lack of permissions)
   the function (missing value for `salesforce_domain` for 500/512 errors)
