# Gemini for Workspace
**alpha**
Please review the [Google Workspace README](../README.md) for general information applicable to
all Google Workspace connectors.

This connector pulls Gemini-events from the Google Workspace audit log. These events were briefly available
in April 2025, but Google has pulled them back as of May 2025.  We anticipate them being available later in 2025.
