# Implementation Guide

This guide provides a roadmap of a typical implementation with Worklytics-provided support.

## 1 Kick-off/Scoping meeting

*30-60 min video call to get overview of process, responsibilities*

Attendees:
  - Product Stakeholder(s)
  - Data Source Administrator(s), if identified
  - IT Admin(s), if identified

Agenda:
 - determine data sources, and who can authorize access to each
 - determine host platform (GCP or AWS)
 - identify who has the permissions to manage infra, will be able to run Terraform, and how
   they'll run it (where, authenticated how)
 - scope desired data interval, approximate headcount, etc.
 - identify any potential integration issues or infrastructure constraints

## 2 Initial Walk through

*1-2 hr video call, to walk-through customization and initial terraform runs via screenshare*

Attendees:
  - IT Admin(s) who will be running Terraform
  - Worklytics technical contact

Prior to this call, please follow the initial steps in the `Getting Started` section for your host
platform and ensure you have all Prereqs

Goals:
  1. get example customized and a terraform plan working.
  2. run `terraform apply`. Obtain the `TODO 1` files you can send to your data source
     administrators to complete, as needed.

Tips:
  - Works best if we screenshare

## 3 Testing / Validation

*can be completed without call; but Worklytics can assist if desired*

  - follow `TODO 2` files / use test.sh shell scripts produced by `terraform apply`
  - validate that authentication/authorization is correct for all connections, and that you're
    satisfied with proxy behavior

## 4 Authorize Worklytics to Access Sanitized Data

*can be completed without call; but Worklytics can assist if desired*

Authorize Worklytics to invoke API connectors / access sanitized bulk data:
  - obtain service account ID of your tenant from Worklytics; configure it in you terraform.tfvars file
  - run `terraform apply` again to update IAM policy to reflect the change

## 5 Connect Sanitized Data Sources to Worklytics

*can be completed without call; but Worklytics can assist if desired*

  - follow `TODO 3` files (or terraform output values) generated by the `terraform apply` command
  - if you do not have access to [Worklytics](https://app.worklytics.co),  or you do, but do not have `Data Connection Admin` role, send
    these files to the appropriate person
