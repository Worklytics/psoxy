# Authentication and Authorization in GCP Deployments of Psoxy

This page provides an overview of how psoxy authenticates and confirms authorization of clients
(Worklytics tenants) to access data for GCP-hosted deployments.

## Authentication

As Worklytics tenants run inside GCP, they are implicitly authenticated by GCP. No secrets or keys
need be exchanged between your Worklytics tenant and your Psoxy instance.  GCP can verify the
identity of requests from Worklytics to your instance, just as it does between any process and
resource within GCP.


## Authorization

Invocations of your proxy instances are authorized by the IAM policies you define in GCP. For API
connectors, you grant the Cloud Function Invoker role to your Worklytics tenant's GCP service account
on the Cloud Function for your instance.

For the bulk data case, you grant the Storage Object Viewer role to your Worklytics tenant's GCP
service account on the sanitized output bucket for your connector.

You can obtain the identity of your Worklytics tenant's GCP service account from the Worklytics
portal.
