### Deployment Environments
Psoxy can be *hosted* in GCP or AWS, but it can be *deployed* to those host platforms from a variety
of locations:

  - local machine (macOS or a Linux such as Ubuntu likely to be most straightforward options)
  - remote VM/container (eg, EC2 instance)
  - CI/CD, such as GitHub Actions, Atlassian Bamboo, etc.
  - [Terraform Cloud / Terraform Enterprise](terraform-cloud.md)
  - Cloud Shell: [aws](aws/cloud-shell.md) (not recommended due to disk size limitation) / [gcp](gcp/cloud-shell.md)
